If you try `elfpeek` on interesting binaries and spot something odd (weird flags, corner cases, broken output), feel free to open an issue or send a small PR.

## Ideas

- Testing on different ELF binaries (stripped, static, PIE, etc.)
- Bug fixes and edge case handling
- Features from the TODO list (32-bit support, `.symtab`, big-endian)

## Code style

- Keep it simple, no over-engineering
- Match the existing style
- Test with `make` before submitting
